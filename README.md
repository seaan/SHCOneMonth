# TEAM 2 One Month Project 2016
Team 2's github repo for our One Month Project.

One Month is a crash-course in building an embedded system conducted by the UAH Space Hardware Club, where new members of the club are paired up with mentors that will guide them through building their first balloon payload. 
Our One Month project concluded in October of 2016, where we successfully flew a payload that gathered temperature and pressure data to calculate altitude, saving all of the data to EEPROM. The
payload indicated its location using a buzzer and LED's mounted to the surface. The buzzer was programmed to play "Camptown Races" upon its descent from the payload line.
