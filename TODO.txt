-take reading from pressure sensor
x-take reading from temperature sensor
x-implement readings from both sensors into all getAltitude calls
x-set LEDs
x-saving data to eeprom, sample rate
x-motor TWR and pulse with modulation.
-figure out the DORD for the SPI shifting, currently set at MSB
-Wireless reciever (oh god)
-RTC records ms, velocity calculations assume s

-Change ports for like everything (LED, Buzzer, Motor TC and stuff)

TEST EVERYTHING!!! ALOT!!!
