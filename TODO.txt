x-take reading from pressure sensor
x-take reading from temperature sensor
x-implement readings from both sensors into all getAltitude calls
x-set LEDs
x-saving data to eeprom, sample rate
x-motor TWR and pulse with modulation.
-figure out the DORD for the SPI shifting, currently set at MSB
-Wireless reciever (oh god)
x-RTC changed to ms, this might cause problems with the velocity calculations
x-Change ports for like everything (LED, Buzzer, Motor TC and stuff)
x-pressure sensor ports
- eeProm can only read 1 byte at a time, time is 32 bit, alt is float atm

TEST EVERYTHING!!! ALOT!!!
