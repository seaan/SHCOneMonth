Cleaning Code
x-Rewrite flight, altitude, velocity methods to be more efficient, take only one reading per calculations
-Rewrite velocity method to differentiate & smooth as you go, instead of having to take 25 samples.
-Move port initalizations to init methods
-eeprom class & methods?
-add hotwire to test class
-add led to test class
-add motors to test class
-add buzzers to test class
-add flight state tests to test class
-write prescalar input switch case into LED class
x-altitude reading to meters
-flight state while loops to meters
-turn motor off
-go through flight state stuff again
